## About Me: ##
    - I'm a second year Computer Science Student at the University of York.
    - My main interests are in AI - safety, verification and applications.
    - I'd like to build a world where machines serve people, not the other way around.

## My Projects: ##
    - A ML model to help students see if they are being overcharged for their rent.
    - A CNN to classify butterfly species, deployed online using Streamlit.
    - A YOLO to identify where forest fires are spreading using satellite video data.
